/**
 * BACKGROUND REFRESHER
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Keeps the stats cache warm on a timer, so GET /coin/stats can answer from
 * memory instead of waiting on an upstream.
 *
 * Without this, a request that lands after the cache's TTL expires pays
 * collect()'s full latency itself — and under load, a pile of them can queue
 * up behind the same in-flight fetch. With this running, cache.get() almost
 * always finds a value younger than its TTL and returns synchronously; the
 * refresh happens on the clock, off the request path entirely.
 *
 * Deliberately thin: all the hard parts — TTL, stale-serve-on-failure,
 * single-flight coalescing — already live in cache.js. This only calls
 * cache.get() on an interval and swallows whatever it throws, so a bad
 * upstream stretch never takes the process down or wipes out the last good
 * payload. cache.js already guarantees the latter (a failed producer call
 * never clears the cached value); this just has to not crash on the former.
 *
 * The refresh itself is never tied to any one HTTP request's lifecycle — it
 * runs on behalf of the shared cache, for whoever asks next — so it carries
 * no AbortSignal. Each individual upstream call still has its own bounded
 * timeout (config.upstreamTimeoutMs, enforced in http.js/rpc.js), so this
 * cannot hang indefinitely even without one.
 *
 * Ported unchanged from the PONSY stats backend (donor: d:\projects\ponsy).
